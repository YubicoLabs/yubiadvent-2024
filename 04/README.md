# PAWSKEYS

Let us print a pawskey: A conatiner for a yubikey that contains a protecting paw. Inplace printed hindge and a pun about Passkeys != Paweskeys, funny indeed.


# Printing

A prusa mk3s was used, white pla, laying on the side, so the hindge gets "the most rounded print" with a crude layer height of 0.2mm. It took abit more then an hour.
